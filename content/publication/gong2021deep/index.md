abstract: Deep learning has achieved excellent performance in a wide range of domains, especially in speech recognition and computer vision. Relatively less work has been done for electroencephalogram (EEG), but there is still significant progress attained in the last decade. Due to the lack of a comprehensive and topic widely covered survey for deep learning in EEG, we attempt to summarize recent progress to provide an overview, as well as perspectives for future developments. We first briefly mention the artifacts removal for EEG signal and then introduce deep learning models that have been utilized in EEG processing and classification. Subsequently, the applications of deep learning in EEG are reviewed by categorizing them into groups, such as brainâ€“computer interface, disease detection, and emotion recognition. They are followed by the discussion, in which the pros and cons of deep learning are presented and future directions and challenges for deep learning in EEG are proposed. We hope that this article could serve as a summary of past work for deep learning in EEG and the beginning of further developments and achievements of EEG studies based on deep learning.
