 <span style="color:blue">I am an incoming Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech starting from 2023 Fall. I will work at the intersection of machine learning and neuroscience. </span>

Hi, I am currently a Master’s Student in [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). 

Before Georgia Tech, I was a Research Assistant in [School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering](https://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) working with [Hesheng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q6AY9XsAAAAJ&hl=en), PhD. I obtained my BEng in Software Engineering and BSc in Biological Sciences at Sichuan University, China, in 2021.

From 01/2021-10/2021, I was a Assistant Investigator in [Lab of Neural Interface](http://english.cebsit.cas.cn/lab/zhaozhengtuo/research/), [Institute of Neuroscience](http://english.cebsit.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/), China, working with [Zhengtuo Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2iEqeocAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), PhD. From 04-2020-01/2021, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Department of Neurology, [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/), [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), working with [Wei-Long Zheng](https://weilongzheng.github.io/), PhD. From 07/2019-09-2019, I was a Deep Learning Summer Intern at [School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/computer-science-and-electronic-engineering) at [University of Essex](https://www.essex.ac.uk/), United Kingdom, working with [Junhua Li](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=ulXjSEUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), PhD.
