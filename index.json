Relatively less work has been done for electroencephalogram (EEG), but there is still significant progress attained in the last decade. Due to the lack of a comprehensive and topic widely covered survey for deep learning in EEG, we attempt to summarize recent progress to provide an overview, as well as perspectives for future developments. We first briefly mention the artifacts removal for EEG signal and then introduce deep learning models that have been utilized in EEG processing and classification. Subsequently, the applications of deep learning in EEG are reviewed by categorizing them into groups, such as brain–computer interface, disease detection, and emotion recognition. They are followed by the discussion, in which the pros and cons of deep learning are presented and future directions and challenges for deep learning in EEG are proposed. We hope that this article could serve as a summary of past work for deep learning in EEG and the beginning of further developments and achievements of EEG studies based on deep learning.","tags":["Deep Learning","EEG","Review"],"title":"Deep Learning in EEG: Advance of the Last Ten -Year Critical Period","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Performed electrode-implantation neurosurgery on mice, built a signal acquisition system to collect their neural signals and motions, and analysed the data from mice using deep learning models.\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"b88c2c4a75951b75f792a9156158ee76","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/cyborg-mouse/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cyborg-mouse/","section":"project","summary":"Performed electrode-implantation neurosurgery on mice, built a signal acquisition system to collect their neural signals and motions, and analysed the data from mice using deep learning models.","tags":["Data Analysis","Software Development"],"title":"Cyborg Mouse","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Designed (Solidworks), manufactured (3D Print \u0026amp; CNC), and assembled (cameras with light modules+ step motors + Arduino) a precise automated neurosurgery robot.\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"a674924b46c58fc71cd372d569ee5509","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/neurosurgery-robot/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/neurosurgery-robot/","section":"project","summary":"Designed (Solidworks), manufactured (3D Print \u0026 CNC), and assembled (cameras with light modules+ step motors + Arduino) a precise automated neurosurgery robot.","tags":["Mechanics"],"title":"Invasive Brain-Machine Interface Robot","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wrote a Unity3D program, developed a 3D simulated mouse, and used C# to reconstruct the activities of the electrode-implanted mouse to 3D simulated mouse in real time\n","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"4347e435af3cbf11d41c2c7af15b8a83","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/motion-reconstruction/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/motion-reconstruction/","section":"project","summary":"Wrote a Unity3D program, developed a 3D simulated mouse, and used C# to reconstruct the activities of the electrode-implanted mouse to 3D simulated mouse in real time","tags":["Data Analysis","Software Development"],"title":"Mouse Motion Reconstruction","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Conducted research on the multitask learning and EEG based emotion recognition and person identification\n","date":1587945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587945600,"objectID":"08131b65f9f0dd864116766da5a1987d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/multitask-learning/","publishdate":"2020-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/multitask-learning/","section":"project","summary":"Conducted research on the multitask learning and EEG based emotion recognition and person identification","tags":["Data Analysis"],"title":"Multitask Learning and EEG","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Read and summarized scientific papers that were published in the past 10 years on the topic of deep learning in EEG signal processing\n","date":1569542400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569542400,"objectID":"0f6bd32030acb7b409718f0d48edf14c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project/deeplearning-eeg-review/","publishdate":"2019-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/deeplearning-eeg-review/","section":"project","summary":"Read and summarized scientific papers that were published in the past 10 years on the topic of deep learning in EEG signal processing","tags":["Data Analysis"],"title":"Survey of Deep Learning in EEG","type":"project"}]
